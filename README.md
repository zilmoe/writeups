# Writeups by zilmoe

This repository contains all of the CTF writups I have authored. They will contain writeups from pwn, reverse engineering, and sometimes cryptography. They serve two purposes:

1. To document my learning and problem-solving process.
2. To share solutions that may help others exploring similar challenges.

## How to Navigate
- Writeups are organized by competition, then challenge, in folders.
- Each writeup is in Markdown format, except for cases when there were requirements by writeup competitions
